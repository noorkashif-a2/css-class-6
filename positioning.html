        HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the standard language used to create and structure content on the web. It
        provides the basic framework for web pages by using a system of tags and elements that tell browsers how to
        display text, images, links, and other media. Each HTML document starts with a `
         declaration, followed by ``, which contains the `

        

        `

            ` holds metadata like the title and links to CSS or JavaScript files, while the `

            ` contains the actual content shown to users, such as paragraphs, headings, lists, images, and
                interactive elements. HTML tags are typically written in pairs, with opening and closing tags like `p`
                    and `p`. Over the years, HTML has evolved significantly, with HTML5 introducing new semantic
                elements like `article`, section`, and `nav` to improve accessibility and structure. These
                            enhancements also support audio, video, and complex graphics without relying on external
                            plugins. HTML is essential for web development and is usually used alongside CSS for styling
                            and JavaScript for interactivity. Understanding HTML is a foundational skill for anyone
                            interested in creating websites or working with web technologies. It is the backbone of the
                            World Wide Web, enabling content to be shared and accessed globally.
